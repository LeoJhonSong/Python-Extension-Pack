# Python Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions I use when developing python code.
I would be glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! :thumbsup:

This pack includes:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Python Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dongli.python-preview)
- [Visual Studio IntelliCode - Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)
- [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

If you find a extension really useful when developing python code and want to
improve this extension, feel free to [raise a issue](https://github.com/LeoJhonSong/Python-Extension-Pack/issues).
But please notice that **issues using the extensions included in this pack**
will not be accepted in this extension pack's repository:sweat_smile:.

**Enjoy!**
